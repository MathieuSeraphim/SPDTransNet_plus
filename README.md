![The SPDTransNet architecture](./_z_miscellaneous/documentation/extras/model_architecture.png)

Still a work in progress. Should be done by Match 8th, 2024 --- March 15th at the latest.

Mean enriched matrices (cf. Figure 2): [here](./_z_miscellaneous/documentation/mean_enriched_matrices)

Detailed results corresponding to all tables: [here](./_z_miscellaneous/documentation/result_tables)

Modified ResNet50 receptive fields (Section 2 of Supplementary Material): [here](./_z_miscellaneous/documentation/extras/IITNet%20modified%20Resnet50%20receptive%20fields.xlsx)

Please refer to [our earlier SPDTransNet repository](https://github.com/MathieuSeraphim/SPDTransNet) until then.
